Cyberbullying or cyberharassment is a form of bullying or harassment using electronic means.
Cyberbullying and cyberharassment are also known as online bullying.
 It has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers.
 Cyberbullying is when someone, typically teens, bully or harass others on the internet, particularly on social media sites.
  Harmful bullying behavior can include posting rumors, threats, sexual remarks, a victims' personal information, or pejorative labels (i.e. hate speech).[2] Bullying or harassment can be identified by repeated behavior and an intent to harm.[3] Victims may experience lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and a variety of negative emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed.[4]

Awareness in the United States has risen in the 2010s, due in part to high-profile cases.
 Several US states and other countries have laws specific to cyberbullying.
 Some are designed to specifically target teen cyberbullying, while others use laws extending from the scope of physical harassment.\
  In cases of adult cyberharassment, these reports are usually filed beginning with local police.

Research has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization.

Internet trolling is a common form of bullying over the Internet in an online community (such as in online gaming or social media) in order to elicit a reaction, disruption, or for someone's own personal amusement.[11][12] Cyberstalking is another form of bullying or harassment that uses electronic communications to stalk a victim; this may pose a credible threat to the victim.[13]

Not all negative interaction online or on social media can be attributed to cyberbullying.
 Research suggests that there are also interactions online that result in peer pressure, which can have a negative,
  positive, or neutral impact on those involved.
